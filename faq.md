# Frequently Asked Questions  

### How do I add new spending entries?  
Go to the Spending List View (far left tab), click the plus icon, and enter your transaction details, including amount, category, and details. Tap "Enter" to save the entry.  Alternatively, you can use Siri shortcuts. Search for and add the track spending shortcut under Spendful (in your Shortcuts app). Then, you can simply say "Hey Siri, track spending." Siri will prompt you for the amount, category, and details of that expense. Note that the category must be one you have previously created for the Siri shortcut to be successful.

### What if I accidentally enter incorrect spending data?  
You can edit or delete entries in the "Spending" tab.  You can also use the "select" toggle to delete many entries at once.

### Can I use Spendful across multiple devices?  
Yes! As long as you are signed in with the same iCloud account, your data will sync automatically across your devices.  

### What happens if I delete the app? Will I lose my data?  
By default, your data is persisted in iCloud, and it will remain there even if you delete the app. When you reinstall and log in with the same iCloud account, your data will be restored. 

### Does Spendful work offline?  
Yes, entries added offline will be synced later.

### How do I back up my data?  
You can create backups in the Advanced Features tab under the "Backup & Restore" section. This allows you to save your data and restore it later if needed. Back ups are created regularly and limited to the most recent thirty.

### How can I use Siri to add new spending entries?
Spendful comes with built-in Siri support to make it easy to add new entries on the go. The first time you download spendful, add the Siri shortcut by opening the Shortcuts app, clicking the plus button (upper right), searching Spendful, and tapping Track Spending. Then click Done (you may also choose to customize the prompt further at this stage). Now, to use the shortcut, just say: "Hey Siri, track spending" and follow the prompts. Note: make sure the appropriate categories have already been set up in the app before attempting to add spending entries to that category using Siri.

### Is Spendful free?  
The basic version of Spendful will always be free. Currently two features (sharing with other household members and recurring expenses) require an in-app purchase of the full version of Spendful. This in-app purchase unlocks the full version of the app; if more features are added later, you won't have to pay for them.

## Full version (paid)

### How do I restore my purchase if I reinstall the app?  
Spendful will automatically restore your in-app purchases if you are signed in with the same Apple ID. If you experience issues, email us at spendfulhelp@gmail.com.

### What features are included in the full version of the app?  
To share spending data with friends, family, or household members or to create recurring expenses, you will need to purchase the premium version of the app. This purchase unlocks lifetime access to the full version of the app. If more features are added later, you won't have to pay for them.

### How do recurring expenses work?  
You can set up recurring expenses for things like rent or subscriptions. Whenever the app is opened, Spendful will check for any past due recurring expenses and add them as new spending entries (youâ€™ll receive an in-app notification when they are added). Then, the next due date for that recurring expenses will be increased by the specified frequency.

### My recurring expenses are not being added
Spendful only checks for past due recurring expenses on app open, so try closing and reopening your app if you are having issues.

### How do I share my data with others?  
Use the "Manage Sharing" section in Advanced features (furthest right tab) to invite iCloud users. Once they accept, they will have access to all of your spending data, both existing and yet to come. For you to access their data, they must also invite you. By default, whomever you share with will have both read and write access; you can change this (e.g. to only read access) under the Manage Sharing section. You can revoke access at any time by returning to the "Manage Sharing" page.


## Sync issues

### Help! My data is out of sync with my shared accounts and/or other devices.
Although rare, occasionally, your local spending data may get out of sync with the server. First, open and close the app and wait a few minutes to see if the issue was just lag and resolves on its own. If it does not, you can continue. Before proceeding, be sure to save a local copy of your data by going to Advanced features (gear tab) and clicking "Export CSV." After you've saved a local copy, go to Settings -> iCloud -> Show all (under apps using iCloud) and toggle off Spendful. Next, close and reopen the Spendful app. Then, return to settings and toggle Spendful back on. Do this on both your device and any sharing devices. After the list views have stopped updating, the data should be back in sync. Data loss is possible during this process, so be sure to check data integrity with the CSV you saved.
