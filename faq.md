# Frequently Asked Questions  

### How do I add new spending entries?  
Go to the Spending List View (far left tab), click the plus icon, and enter your transaction details, including amount, category, and details. Tap "Enter" to save the entry.  Alternatively, you can use Siri shortcuts. Search for and add the track spending shortcut under Spendful (in your Shortcuts app). Then, you can simply say "Hey Siri, track spending." Siri will prompt you for the amount, category, and details of that expense. Note that the category must be one you have previously created for the Siri shortcut to be successful.

### How do I share my data with others?  
Use the "Manage Sharing" section in Advanced features (furthest right tab) to invite iCloud users. Once they accept, they will see all shared spending entries automatically. For you to access their data, they must also invite you. By default, whomever you share with will have read/write access; you can change this under the Manage Sharing section.

### Can I use Spendful across multiple devices?  
Yes! As long as you are signed in with the same iCloud account, your data will sync automatically across your devices.  

### What if I accidentally enter incorrect spending data?  
You can edit or delete entries in the "Spending" tab.  You can also use the "select" toggle to delete many entries at once.

### How do recurring expenses work?  
You can set up recurring expenses for things like rent or subscriptions. Spendful will automatically add them when they are past their due date and at the chosen frequency, and youâ€™ll receive an in-app notification when they are added.  

### What happens if I delete the app? Will I lose my data?  
By default, your data is persisted in iCloud, and it will remain there even if you delete the app. When you reinstall and log in with the same iCloud account, your data will be restored. 

### Does Spendful work offline?  
Yes, entries added offline will be synced later.

### How do I back up my data?  
You can create backups in the Advanced Features tab under the "Backup & Restore" section. This allows you to save your data and restore it later if needed. Back ups are created regularly and limited to the most recent thirty.

### Is Spendful free?  
The basic version of Spendful is free. Currently two features (sharing with other household members and recurring expenses) require an in-app purchase for Spendful Premium. This in-app purchase unlocks the full version of the app; if more features are added later, you won't have to pay for them.

### What features are included in the premium version?  
To share spending data with friends, family, or household members or to create recurring expenses, you will need to purchase the premium version of the app. This purchase unlocks the full version of the app. If more features are added later, you won't have to pay for them.

### How do I restore my purchase if I reinstall the app?  
Spendful will automatically restore your in-app purchases if you are signed in with the same Apple ID. If you experience issues, email us at spendfulhelp@gmail.com.
